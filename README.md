Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a system approach that appiles engineering principles , tools and methods to the development and deployment of high quality software. It is important because it allows for development of high quality software and meeting budget or time constraints


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of Programming Languages such as Fortran and C , the recognition of software engineering as a discipline  in the 1960s. the rise of structured programming in 1970s and the advent of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering - phase where user's needs and requirements are gathered and document and the feasibility of the project is evaluated
Design - blueprint of the solution is products , this includes a high level overview of the solution and user interface
Development - the actual software is produced through coding following design specifications
Testing - the product is tested to ensure it means user requirements and purpose.
Deployment - releasing to software to users and any stakeholders like staff

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is rigid while agile is more flexible. Waterfall has extensive documentation while agile does not have high emphasis on documentation. Waterfall is used when there are clear and stable requirements while Agile is used when there are uncertain or changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions 
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software is of high quality 
Project manager - oversees the planning , execution and delivery of project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's help with increased productivity amd improved code quality. Examples of IDE's are Visual Studio Code. VCS help with collaboration , backup and recovery. Examples of VCS are Git , Subversion and Mercurial 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Complexity Management: Use modular design and thorough documentation.
Keeping Up with Technology: Engage in continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
Debugging: Implement robust logging and systematic debugging.
Technical Debt: Regularly refactor and balance new features with code improvements.
Communication Issues: Foster clear communication and use Agile methodologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components. Ensures each unit functions correctly.
Integration Testing: Tests interactions between components. Validates combined functionality.
System Testing: Tests the entire system. Ensures it meets requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Verifies the software meets business requirements and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting prompts to guide AI models for accurate and relevant responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about software.”
Improved Prompt: “Explain Agile vs. Waterfall methodologies, including their pros and cons.”
